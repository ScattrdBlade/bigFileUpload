# Big File Upload (Vencord)
This is a Vencord plugin that allows you to bypass Discord's upload limit. It adds the `Upload a Big File` button (located under the regular upload button) and `/fileupload` command. This allows you to upload files to Discord by uploading them to uploaders such as gofile.io, catbox.moe, litterbox, or a custom uploader of your choice that allows you to import ShareX config files, and then automatically pasting the link containing the upload into your Discord chatbox. This is essentially a quick way to upload big files to Discord without nitro.

## DOWNLOAD INSTRUCTIONS
You can either __git clone__ the repository OR __manually install__ it by downloading it as a zip file.<br/>
> [!WARNING]
> Make sure you have the Vencord [developer build](https://docs.vencord.dev/installing/) installed.<br/>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Inside the `Vencord` folder should be a folder called `src`. If you haven't already, create a folder called `userplugins` inside the `src` folder.
